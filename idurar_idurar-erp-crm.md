Workspace: I'm sorry, I can't answer that question with what I currently know about your workspace.

sumitchohan: @workspace generate plant uml component diagrams for all components in current code base

Workspace: To generate PlantUML component diagrams for all components in your current codebase, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify Components**: Based on the provided structure and code excerpts, identify the main components. For example, components in [`frontend/src/router/routes.jsx`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fidurar-erp-crm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Frouter%2Froutes.jsx%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/workspaces/idurar-erp-crm/frontend/src/router/routes.jsx") and [`frontend/src/forms/DynamicForm/index.jsx`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fidurar-erp-crm%2Ffrontend%2Fsrc%2Fforms%2FDynamicForm%2Findex.jsx%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/workspaces/idurar-erp-crm/frontend/src/forms/DynamicForm/index.jsx").

2. **Create PlantUML Diagrams**: Write PlantUML code to represent these components and their relationships.

Here are some example PlantUML diagrams for the identified components:

It performs the following steps:

1. **Initialize Model**: 
   ```javascript
   const Model = mongoose.model('Client');
   ```

   ```

- **Description**: This asynchronous function handles HTTP requests to list all documents from a specified MongoDB model. It filters out documents marked as removed, sorts the results, populates any referenced documents, applies a migration function to each document, and sends the results back in the HTTP response.
- **Parameters**:
  - [`Model`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22Model%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fidurar-erp-crm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcontrollers%2FappControllers%2FclientController%2FlistAll.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fworkspaces%2Fidurar-erp-crm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcontrollers%2FappControllers%2FclientController%2FlistAll.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fidurar-erp-crm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcontrollers%2FappControllers%2FclientController%2FlistAll.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A2%2C%22character%22%3A23%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") (Mongoose Model): The Mongoose model to query.
  - [`req`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22req%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fidurar-erp-crm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcontrollers%2FappControllers%2FclientController%2FlistAll.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fworkspaces%2Fidurar-erp-crm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcontrollers%2FappControllers%2FclientController%2FlistAll.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fidurar-erp-crm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcontrollers%2FappControllers%2FclientController%2FlistAll.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A2%2C%22character%22%3A30%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") (Object): The HTTP request object.

- **Pseudo Logic**:
  1. Parse the [`sort`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22sort%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fidurar-erp-crm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcontrollers%2FappControllers%2FclientController%2FlistAll.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fworkspaces%2Fidurar-erp-crm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcontrollers%2FappControllers%2FclientController%2FlistAll.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fidurar-erp-crm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcontrollers%2FappControllers%2FclientController%2FlistAll.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") query parameter from the request, defaulting to 'desc' if not provided.
  2. Query the database using the provided [`Model`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22Model%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fidurar-erp-crm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcontrollers%2FappControllers%2FclientController%2FlistAll.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fworkspaces%2Fidurar-erp-crm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcontrollers%2FappControllers%2FclientController%2FlistAll.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fidurar-erp-crm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcontrollers%2FappControllers%2FclientController%2FlistAll.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A2%2C%22character%22%3A23%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") to find all documents where [`removed`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22removed%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fidurar-erp-crm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcontrollers%2FappControllers%2FclientController%2FlistAll.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fworkspaces%2Fidurar-erp-crm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcontrollers%2FappControllers%2FclientController%2FlistAll.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fidurar-erp-crm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcontrollers%2FappControllers%2FclientController%2FlistAll.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A7%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") is [`false`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22false%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fidurar-erp-crm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcontrollers%2FappControllers%2FclientController%2FlistAll.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fworkspaces%2Fidurar-erp-crm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcontrollers%2FappControllers%2FclientController%2FlistAll.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fidurar-erp-crm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcontrollers%2FappControllers%2FclientController%2FlistAll.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A7%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition").
  3. Sort the results by the [`created`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22created%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fidurar-erp-crm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcontrollers%2FappControllers%2FclientController%2FlistAll.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fworkspaces%2Fidurar-erp-crm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcontrollers%2FappControllers%2FclientController%2FlistAll.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fidurar-erp-crm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcontrollers%2FappControllers%2FclientController%2FlistAll.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A9%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") field in the specified order.
  4. Populate any referenced documents.
  5. Execute the query.
  6. Apply the [`migrate`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22migrate%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fidurar-erp-crm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcontrollers%2FappControllers%2FclientController%2FlistAll.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fworkspaces%2Fidurar-erp-crm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcontrollers%2FappControllers%2FclientController%2FlistAll.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fidurar-erp-crm%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fcontrollers%2FappControllers%2FclientController%2FlistAll.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A13%2C%22character%22%3A41%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") function to each document in the result set.
  7. If there are results, send a 200 HTTP response with the migrated data.
  8. If there are no results, send a 404 HTTP response indicating no documents were found.

#### Code

```javascript
const { migrate } = require('./migrate');

const listAll = async (Model, req, res) => {

    const result = await Model.find({
      removed: false,
    })
      .sort({ created: sort })
      .populate()
      .exec();

    // Apply the migrate function to each document in the result set
    const migratedData = result.map((x) => migrate(x));

    // If results are found, send a 200 response with the migrated data
    if (result.length > 0) {
      return res.status(200).json({
        success: true,
        result: migratedData,
      });
    } else {
      // If no results are found, send a 404 response
      return res.status(404).json({
        success: false,
        message: 'No documents found',
      });
    }
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle any errors that occur during the query
    return res.status(500).json({
      success: false,
      message: 'An error occurred while retrieving documents',
      error: error.message,

#### Error Handling
- If an error occurs during the database query, a 500 HTTP response is sent with an error message.
