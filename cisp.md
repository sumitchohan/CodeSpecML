sumitchohan: @workspace create another plant uml diagram showing relationships among all business entities and data models


Workspace: To create a PlantUML diagram showing the relationships among all business entities and data models in your workspace, we need to identify the key entities and their interactions. Based on the provided information, here is a PlantUML diagram that captures these relationships:

```plantuml
@startuml

package "Controllers" {
    component "index.cbl" as IndexController
    component "showname.cbl" as ShowNameController
    component "showsum.cbl" as ShowSumController
}

package "Views" {
    component "hello.cow" as HelloView
    component "index.cow" as IndexView
    component "showsum.cow" as ShowSumView
}

package "Templates" {
    component "cowtemplate.cbl" as CowTemplate
}

package "Data Models" {
    class "SumResult" {
        + PIC Z(36) sum-result
    }
    class "Vars" {
        + PIC X(99) COW-varname[99]
        + PIC X(99) COW-varvalue[99]
    }
    class "ReceivedValues" {
        + PIC X(90) query-value-name[10]
        + PIC X(90) query-value[10]
    }
}

IndexController --> IndexView : renders
ShowNameController --> HelloView : renders
ShowSumController --> ShowSumView : renders
ShowSumController --> CowTemplate : uses
ShowSumController --> SumResult : computes
ShowSumController --> Vars : populates
ShowSumController --> ReceivedValues : receives

The provided excerpt does not include any specific procedures or methods, but we can infer the following based on typical COBOL structure:

### Pseudo Logic
1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize the web application.
   - Set up necessary variables and configurations.

2. **Handling Requests**:
   - Parse incoming HTTP requests.
   - Determine the route and corresponding controller to handle the request.

3. **Rendering Views**:
   - Use the [`COW-vars`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22COW-vars%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fcobol-on-wheelchair%2Fcontrollers%2Findex.cbl%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fworkspaces%2Fcobol-on-wheelchair%2Fcontrollers%2Findex.cbl%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fcobol-on-wheelchair%2Fcontrollers%2Findex.cbl%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A10%2C%22character%22%3A14%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") array to store dynamic content.
   - Render the appropriate view template based on the request.

4. **Response**:
   - Send the rendered HTML back to the client as the HTTP response.

### Example Pseudo Code
```plaintext
1. Start the program.
2. Initialize working-storage variables.
3. Wait for an incoming HTTP request.
4. Parse the request to determine the route.
5. If the route is 'index', call the index controller.
6. In the index controller:
   a. Populate `COW-vars` with necessary data.
   b. Render the `index.cow` view using `COW-vars`.
7. Send the rendered HTML as the HTTP response.
8. End the program.
```

### Pseudo Logic
1. **Server Initialization**:
   - Set the server root directory to `/usr/lib/apache2`.
   - Load the necessary modules for authorization, CGI execution, directory handling, MIME type mapping, event-based processing, and URL rewriting.

2. **Configuration Loading**:
   - Load MIME type definitions from `/etc/mime.types`.
   - Record the server's PID in `/tmp/httpd.pid`.

3. **User and Group Settings**:
   - Run the server under the [`www-data`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22www-data%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fcobol-on-wheelchair%2Fapache.conf%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fworkspaces%2Fcobol-on-wheelchair%2Fapache.conf%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fcobol-on-wheelchair%2Fapache.conf%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A9%2C%22character%22%3A5%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") user and group.

4. **Network Configuration**:
   - Listen for incoming requests on all IP addresses on port 80.

5. **Logging Configuration**:
   - Log error messages to `/dev/stderr`.
   - Log access requests to `/dev/stderr`.

6. **Document Root and Index**:
   - Serve files from the `/cow` directory.
   - Use [`index.html`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22index.html%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fcobol-on-wheelchair%2Fapache.conf%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fworkspaces%2Fcobol-on-wheelchair%2Fapache.conf%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fcobol-on-wheelchair%2Fapache.conf%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A15%2C%22character%22%3A15%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") as the default file for directory requests.

7. **Directory Configuration**:
   - For the root directory, do not allow [`.htaccess`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fcobol-on-wheelchair%2F.htaccess%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/workspaces/cobol-on-wheelchair/.htaccess") files to override any configuration directives.

### Example Pseudo Code
```plaintext
1. Set ServerRoot to "/usr/lib/apache2".
2. Load modules:
   - authz_core_module
   - cgid_module
   - dir_module
   - mime_module
   - mpm_event_module
   - rewrite_module
3. Set TypesConfig to "/etc/mime.types".
4. Set PidFile to "/tmp/httpd.pid".
5. Set User to "www-data".
6. Set Group to "www-data".
7. Listen on "*:80".
8. Set ErrorLog to "/dev/stderr".
9. Set TransferLog to "/dev/stderr".
10. Set DocumentRoot to "/cow".
11. Set DirectoryIndex to "index.html".
12. For the root directory:
    - Set AllowOverride to "None".
```

### Summary
The [`apache.conf`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fcobol-on-wheelchair%2Fapache.conf%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/workspaces/cobol-on-wheelchair/apache.conf") file configures the Apache HTTP Server with essential settings such as the server root directory, loaded modules, MIME type definitions, user and group settings, network listening address, logging paths, document root, and directory index. It also specifies that [`.htaccess`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fcobol-on-wheelchair%2F.htaccess%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/workspaces/cobol-on-wheelchair/.htaccess") files are not allowed to override any configuration directives for the root directory. This configuration ensures that the server runs with the specified settings and serves content from the designated document root.
